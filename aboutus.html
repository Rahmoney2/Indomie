            <h2>THE INDOMITABLES</h2>
            <p>
                As a household name in Nigeria, we also wanted to stamp our authority as every <br>
                kid’s favorite brand so we decided to identify with something they all love- <br>
                SUPERHEROES!!
                <br>
                <br>

                This led to the birth of the INDOMITABLES, five Indomie superheroes ( BIGBOY, <br> 
                SWIFTY, STRETCHY,VISION & TWEENY) with amazing superpowers that match <br>
                all the different nutrients kids get from Indomie noodles. The first and most <br>
                popular Indomitable is BIGBOY– he is the epitome of strength, courage and <br>
                invincibility. The next indomitable is the female superhero SWIFTY, and she has <br>
                the power of speed and agility. STRETCHY is flexible and embodies the natural <br>
                ability to take on any shape or form. VISION has Ultra super sights and releases <br>
                laser through his eyes while TWEENY has the power of invisibility. She can <br>
                pass through any body of “matter” effortlessly. These five indomitables were created <br>
                to inspire kids to achieve greatness and be superheroes in their everyday life.
